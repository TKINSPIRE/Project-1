        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m a business specialist with experience in working with technology companies of all sizes. I have worked with companies that were pre-revenue, to those that went public or  acquired by larger companies. I am excited to work with designers, programmers, and engineers who want to turn their ideas into reality. </p>
        <p>I have an undergraduate honours degree in Commerce from Queen's University, and a graduate diploma in Accounting, also from Queen's University.</p>
